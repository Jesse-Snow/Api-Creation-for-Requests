# Api-Creation-for-Requests

I use Node.js to test how requests works and create a Data Base in memory to do CRUD operations.

The dataBase.js simulate a data base using the CRUD operations.

The server.js use the Framework express for do http requests.

And i use Postman to do all types of requests created in server.js.
